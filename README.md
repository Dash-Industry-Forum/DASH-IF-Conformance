## Hosted versions

DASH-IF provides hosted versions of the Conformance Tools. Currently this is done as follows:

|URL| Version                             |Branch|
|---|-------------------------------------|---|
|https://conformance.dashif.org/| 1.0.0                               |https://github.com/Dash-Industry-Forum/DASH-IF-Conformance/releases/tag/v1.0.0|
|https://beta.conformance.dashif.org/| latest released version, e.g. 2.0.0 |master|
|https://staging.conformance.dashif.org/| latest development version          |development|

As part of the JCCP project a major refactoring was done with version 2.0.0. To
offer users the possibility to fall back to version 1.0.0 of the tools three installations are maintained at this point (see table
above). At some point https://conformance.dashif.org/ will be replaced with the content that is currently available
at https://beta.conformance.dashif.org/.
